# Marketing Campaign Assets

Use this folder to store screenshots, design mockups, and downloadable resources referenced by the campaign docs. Name files with the campaign slug and asset type (e.g., `mymi-gold-and-coin-dashboard.png`) so automations can map them back to the correct blueprint.

Keep exports lightweight (≤ 1 MB) and mirror the asset list in each campaign doc’s Section 6 when a new file is added. Remove superseded assets after updating the docs and version the replacements with timestamps.
