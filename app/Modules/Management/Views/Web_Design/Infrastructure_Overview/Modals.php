				When a trader looks at the price chart of a stock, it can appear to be completely random movements. This is often true and, yet, within those price movements are patterns. Chart patterns are geometric shapes found in the price data that can help a trader understand the price action, as well as make predictions about where the price is likely to go. Continuation patterns, when they occur, indicate that a price trend is likely to continue. This article provides an introduction to continuation patterns, explaining what these patterns are and how to spot them.

				Momentum investing usually involves a strict set of rules based on technical indicators that dictate market entry and exit points for particular securities. Momentum investors sometimes use two longer-term moving averages, one a bit shorter than the other, for trading signals. Some use 50-day and 200-day moving averages, for example. The 50-day crossing above the 200-day creates a buy signal. A 50-day crossing back below the 200-day creates a sell signal. A few momentum investors prefer to use even longer-term moving averages for signaling purposes.

				Options are financial instruments that are derivatives based on the value of underlying securities such as stocks. An options contract offers the buyer the opportunity to buy or sell—depending on the type of contract they hold—the underlying asset. Unlike futures, the holder is not required to buy or sell the asset if they choose not to.

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Call options</strong> allow the holder to buy the asset at a stated price within a specific timeframe. We purchase these positions when we expected the specified stock price to <strong>increase</strong> over an allotted amount of time.</li>
					<li><strong>Put options</strong> allow the holder to sell the asset at a stated price within a specific timeframe. We purchase these positions when we expected the specified stock price to <strong>decrease</strong> over an allotted amount of time.</li>

				<strong>Overbought</strong> is a term used when a security is believed to be trading at level currently above its intrinsic or fair value. Overbought generally describes recent or short-term movement in the price of the security, and reflects an expectation that the market will correct the price in the near future. This belief is often the result of technical analysis of the security’s price history, but fundamentals may also be employed. A stock that is overbought may be a good candidate for sale.
				<br>
				<br>
				An <strong>Oversold Bounce</strong> is a rally in prices that occurs due to the selloff preceding it being perceived as too severe. Before an oversold bounve, due to behavioral tendencies such as herding behavior, aversion to loss, and the temptation to panic, prices can decline more than they should based on technical and/or fundamental analysis.

				Resistance, or a resistance level, is the price at which the the price of an asset meets pressure on its way up by the emergence of a growing number of sellers who wish to sell at that price. Resistance levels can be short-lived if new information comes to light that changes the overall market’s attitude toward the asset, or they can be long-lasting. In terms of technical analysis, the simple resistance level can be charted by drawing a line along the highest highs for the time period being considered. Resistance can be contrasted with support.

				Support, or a support level, refers to the price level that an asset does not fall below for period of time. An asset's support level is created by buyers entering the market whenever the asset dips to a lower price. In technical analysis, the simple support level can be charted by drawing a line along the lowest lows for the time period being considered. The support line can be flat or slanted up or down with the overall price trend. Other technical indicators and charting techniques can be used to identify more advanced versions of support.
