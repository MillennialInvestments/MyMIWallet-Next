                                                This article will review the power and benefits behind how our Investor Profiles work. 
                                                By understanding the philosophy and goal of an Investor, you can begin analyze and calculate similarities between one trader and the next regarding their investment strategies and goals. 
                                                In these scenarios, you can begin to analyze how decisions are made when utilizing specific trading strategies and begin to pre-calculate the results based on historical data and events in comparison to Real-Time Data and forward-looking analysis.
