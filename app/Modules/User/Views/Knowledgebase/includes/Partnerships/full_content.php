                                We developed MyMI Partnerships to allow Individuals and Businesses to have the ability to access our Investment Accounting, Analytical, and Exchange resources. 
                                As we were developing the MyMI Partnerships, we envisioned providing individuals and businesses alike, the ability to access the resources that we're developing and utilize those resources in their daily activities.

                                By considering those possibilities, we developed, we developed the MyMI Partnership Program. 
                                The MyMI Partnership Program was designed and continues to be developed to assist all use-cases in terms of financial investments, shared assets/revenue projects, and more.
