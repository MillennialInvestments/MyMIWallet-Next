                                        Investing refers to the process of allocating money or capital into financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate, with the expectation of generating a profit or return over time. 
                                        The primary objective of investing is to grow your wealth, create passive income, and ultimately achieve financial goals.

                                        While both investing and saving involve setting aside money for future use, they serve different purposes. 
                                        Saving focuses on preserving capital and maintaining easy access to funds, typically in low-risk vehicles like savings accounts or certificates of deposit. 
                                        Investing, on the other hand, involves taking calculated risks to grow your wealth over the long term.

                                        Compound interest is the process by which your initial investment generates earnings, and those earnings, in turn, generate their own earnings. 
                                        Over time, compound interest can significantly boost the growth of your investments, particularly when you reinvest the earnings. 
                                        The power of compounding is a key reason why starting to invest early is crucial for long-term financial success.

                                        Long-term investing focuses on building wealth over an extended period, usually several years or decades. 
                                        It typically involves a buy-and-hold approach, riding out market fluctuations, and benefiting from the long-term growth of investments. 
                                        Short-term investing, on the other hand, seeks to capitalize on market movements and trends over a shorter time frame, often involving more frequent buying and selling of assets. 
                                        For most individual investors, long-term investing is a more sustainable and less risky approach.

                                        Risk refers to the possibility of losing some or all of your investment, while reward represents the potential gains from an investment. 
                                        Generally, investments with higher potential rewards also come with higher risks.

                                        The risk-reward trade-off is the principle that higher potential returns come with higher risks, and lower risks are associated with lower potential returns. 
                                        To achieve higher returns, investors must be willing to accept more risk. 
                                        The challenge is finding the right balance between risk and reward that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

                                        Rebalancing is the process of adjusting your investments to bring your portfolio back in line with your target asset allocation. 
                                        This helps maintain diversification and ensures that your portfolio continues to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
