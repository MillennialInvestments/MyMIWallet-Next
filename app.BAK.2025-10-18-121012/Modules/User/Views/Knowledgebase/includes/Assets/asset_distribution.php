                                As you become more involved with MyMI Wallet and truly access the potential of our Asset Exchange, you will discover that the purchase of some assets could result in residual payments from Shared Revenue. 
                                After gaining ownership of specific types of Assets, the creator of those assets will be given the ability to share the revenue stream earned from the investment of that asset pool and what the asset was created/designed to produce.                                                                
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead fs-14px">   
                                If you are the recipient of Residual Income from an owned Asset, you will receive your Residual Payments credited to your account in the form of MyMI Gold on the 15th of every month.
